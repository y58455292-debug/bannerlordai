# Codex Status

## Current checkpoint

Phase 6-v1 has completed its first **bounded civic-project runtime characterization**.

**Runtime result: BOUNDED NULL FOR THE TARGET SUBSTITUTION BRANCH — the selected wrapper and native final commit authority are runtime-observed, but no naturally qualifying low-loyalty NPC-town evaluation occurred inside 155.788 campaign hours. Genuine Festival substitution remains runtime-unobserved.**

The active selected model was exactly `CivicProjectBuildingScoreCalculationModel` wrapping the audited `DefaultBuildingScoreCalculationModel`. Two natural NPC-town evaluations occurred. Zeonica was an active-construction passthrough; Marunath was an idle high-loyalty passthrough at loyalty 94.79668 versus native threshold 25, preserving native `Train Militia` exactly. Bannerlord's native `BuildingHelper.ChangeDefaultBuilding` path then committed the returned choices, with `mutationByClanAI=False`. No evaluated NPC town crossed the strict low-loyalty gate, so no `preferFestival=True`, genuine substitution, or substituted-Festival native commit is claimed.

Observation-only telemetry was committed before deployment at `f0fe5b86aa71bd0df349d05858fc6ab203fcf30b`; runtime DLL SHA-256 was `2909ADE31B427E122FDDE539229BD0A4A2B4FA91C84CFD3AB63D0C8EB6F729D7`. The protected fixture was unchanged, zero save commands and zero telemetry errors occurred, Strategic Commitment remained Observe, Visual War remained OFF, rollback stayed intact, and Bannerlord closed after `EXIT_NOSAVE`. Phase 4A remains closed. Phase 4B/4C and Phase 5-v1 remain unchanged; their balance remains unproven. Phase 7 has not started.

## Native ecology finding

Bannerlord does not use one universal bandit spawn path.

Ambient native systems include separate:

- global looter population refill;
- culture-bandit populations tied to infested hideouts;
- hideout infestation/replacement;
- quest/incident/deserter bandits;
- native Guard House patrol parties;
- generic lord/patrol combat suppression.

Native bandit counts are already bounded by `DefaultBanditDensityModel` and `BanditSpawnCampaignBehavior`.

## Selected Phase 5-v1 seam

The implemented v1 seam is native:

`BanditSpawnCampaignBehavior.GetSpawnChanceInSettlement(Settlement)`

A narrow postfix/result modifier applies **only for town/village candidates** with usable Security, which are the ambient looter spawn anchors.

Hideout candidates pass through native exactly.

This changes only **where** native looter pressure is relatively likely to appear. It does not change global looter quantity, hideout-bandit production, culture/templates, party creation, movement, or removal.

## Local-control input

Use **Security only**.

Town:

`Town.Security`

Village:

bound fortification `Town.Security` when safely available.

Missing Security -> native passthrough.

Security is deliberately the only v1 input because native Security already aggregates garrison, looted villages, siege, nearby infested hideouts, patrol-party bonuses, policies/projects/issues/perks and native drift.

Native bandit victories/defeats and hideout clearing also change nearby Security, creating an existing control feedback loop.

## Candidate first safety bounds

`controlMultiplier = clamp(1.25 - 0.005 * clamp(Security,0,100), 0.75, 1.25)`

Examples:

- Security 0 -> 1.25;
- 25 -> 1.125;
- 50 -> 1.00;
- 75 -> 0.875;
- 100 -> 0.75.

`finalSpawnWeight = nativeSpawnWeight * controlMultiplier`

This is a relative **selection weight**, not a spawn-rate multiplier.

The bounds are first-candidate safety limits, not balance claims.

Native global looter caps/refill remain untouched and secure territory never receives a zero weight.

## Native patrol/lord suppression

Native towns with Guard Houses already generate culture-native patrol parties.

Native AI already gives patrols stronger willingness/range against bandits, while independent lords can engage bandits through the generic initiative system when strength/distance/readiness permit.

No custom patrol party type is needed.

## Existing BannerlordAI interactions

Home Responsibility already biases native home patrol/defend candidates during war but does not spawn or target bandits directly.

Visual War already contains an optional rear-security bandit `EngageParty` modifier (weak recovery skip; approximately 1.25 for <=90 men and 1.15 for <=160). Phase 5-v1 should not retune or require that system.

WarState raid/scar memory is deferred to avoid double counting damage already represented by native Security.

## Next bounded milestone

The first Phase 6-v1 runtime characterization is complete as a bounded target-branch null.

Preserve the result. Do not lower the native loyalty threshold, change native daily-project cadence, alter loyalty, clear construction queues, force Festival and Games, broaden the Phase 6 input set, or patch `BuildingHelper.ChangeDefaultBuilding` merely to obtain a positive substitution.

Stop at this checkpoint. Do not begin another Phase 6 feature or Phase 7 in the same task.

Final product direction remains standalone, installable, and offline with no runtime development-tool dependency.
