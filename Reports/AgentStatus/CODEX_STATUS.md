# Codex Status

## Current checkpoint

Phase 5-v1 has completed its **offline-only Local Bandit Control implementation checkpoint**.

**Implementation result: PASS — the audited town/village ambient-looter spawn-site weight modifier is implemented and build-proven. Runtime observation and balance proof have NOT been performed.**

The implementation uses only native Security, preserves unsupported/hideout results exactly, changes only the returned relative spawn-site weight through a postfix, and adds no party/world mutation. Phase 4A remains closed. Phase 4B and Phase 4C remain unchanged at their accepted implemented/build-proven/runtime-observed checkpoints; their balance remains unproven. Phase 6 has not started.

## Native ecology finding

Bannerlord does not use one universal bandit spawn path.

Ambient native systems include separate:

- global looter population refill;
- culture-bandit populations tied to infested hideouts;
- hideout infestation/replacement;
- quest/incident/deserter bandits;
- native Guard House patrol parties;
- generic lord/patrol combat suppression.

Native bandit counts are already bounded by `DefaultBanditDensityModel` and `BanditSpawnCampaignBehavior`.

## Selected Phase 5-v1 seam

The implemented v1 seam is native:

`BanditSpawnCampaignBehavior.GetSpawnChanceInSettlement(Settlement)`

A narrow postfix/result modifier applies **only for town/village candidates** with usable Security, which are the ambient looter spawn anchors.

Hideout candidates pass through native exactly.

This changes only **where** native looter pressure is relatively likely to appear. It does not change global looter quantity, hideout-bandit production, culture/templates, party creation, movement, or removal.

## Local-control input

Use **Security only**.

Town:

`Town.Security`

Village:

bound fortification `Town.Security` when safely available.

Missing Security -> native passthrough.

Security is deliberately the only v1 input because native Security already aggregates garrison, looted villages, siege, nearby infested hideouts, patrol-party bonuses, policies/projects/issues/perks and native drift.

Native bandit victories/defeats and hideout clearing also change nearby Security, creating an existing control feedback loop.

## Candidate first safety bounds

`controlMultiplier = clamp(1.25 - 0.005 * clamp(Security,0,100), 0.75, 1.25)`

Examples:

- Security 0 -> 1.25;
- 25 -> 1.125;
- 50 -> 1.00;
- 75 -> 0.875;
- 100 -> 0.75.

`finalSpawnWeight = nativeSpawnWeight * controlMultiplier`

This is a relative **selection weight**, not a spawn-rate multiplier.

The bounds are first-candidate safety limits, not balance claims.

Native global looter caps/refill remain untouched and secure territory never receives a zero weight.

## Native patrol/lord suppression

Native towns with Guard Houses already generate culture-native patrol parties.

Native AI already gives patrols stronger willingness/range against bandits, while independent lords can engage bandits through the generic initiative system when strength/distance/readiness permit.

No custom patrol party type is needed.

## Existing BannerlordAI interactions

Home Responsibility already biases native home patrol/defend candidates during war but does not spawn or target bandits directly.

Visual War already contains an optional rear-security bandit `EngageParty` modifier (weak recovery skip; approximately 1.25 for <=90 men and 1.15 for <=160). Phase 5-v1 should not retune or require that system.

WarState raid/scar memory is deferred to avoid double counting damage already represented by native Security.

## Next bounded milestone

The next milestone is a **separately authorized bounded Phase 5 runtime characterization of this exact validated candidate**.

Do not launch it from this offline checkpoint. Do not retune the 0.75..1.25 bounds, add additional inputs, broaden the seam, or begin Phase 6.

Final product direction remains standalone, installable, and offline with no runtime development-tool dependency.
