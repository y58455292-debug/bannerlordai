    /// of patches for a diagnostic. This does not attribute cost to a specific mod, but it does say
    /// which phase is eating the frame, and the per-party phases are the ones that multiply.

    /// whatever is calling it. These go on once, before a campaign exists, and are never touched
    /// again.

    /// COST. A Stopwatch timestamp pair per call. On AiHourlyTick with 5000 parties that is 5000
    /// timestamp pairs an in-game hour - tens of microseconds total, against a phase that takes
    /// milliseconds. If that ever stopped being true, the honest thing would be to make it opt-in;
