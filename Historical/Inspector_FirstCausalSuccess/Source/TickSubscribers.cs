    /// WHY THIS EXISTS. Phase timing said the daily tick costs 604 ms in a single call, which names
    /// the moment but not the culprit: every mod's daily work runs inside that one call. The
    /// dispatcher fans out through MbEvent, and each subscriber is a delegate held in a linked list
    /// of EventHandlerRec nodes - each node carrying the Action and the Owner object. Walking that
    /// list turns "the daily tick is slow" into a list of named methods with the mod they came from.
    ///
    /// This walk is READ-ONLY and cheap: a handful of pointer hops per event, done on demand rather
    /// than every frame. It patches nothing, so it cannot break the ordering or the behaviour of the
    /// events it inspects - which matters, because tick order between mods is load-bearing and a
    /// diagnostic has no business changing it.
    ///
    /// It reports who subscribes, not how long each one takes. That is a deliberate stopping point:
    /// timing them individually means patching every subscriber, and the honest first step is to see
    /// how many there are and whose they are. Often that alone is the answer - one mod with forty
    /// daily subscribers on a five-thousand-party world does not need a stopwatch to be suspicious.
