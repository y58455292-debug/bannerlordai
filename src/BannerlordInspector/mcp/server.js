/**
 * MCP bridge to a running Bannerlord campaign.
 *
 * The game side (the BannerlordInspector module) serves read-only JSON on loopback. This process
 * exposes that as MCP tools. It holds no state and caches nothing: every tool call is a fresh HTTP
 * GET, because the whole point is to see what the game looks like *now*.
 *
 * The game server accepts GET and nothing else, so there is no verb this bridge could use to change
 * a campaign even if it tried. The single exception is bannerlord_call, which invokes
 * question-shaped methods only and is fenced on the game side - see its description.
